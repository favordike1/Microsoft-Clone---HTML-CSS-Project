# Microsoft-Clone---HTML-CSS-Project
This is a responsive (though not fully dynamic) clone of the Microsoft homepage, created using pure HTML and CSS. While some interactivity could have been enhanced with JavaScript, this project showcases my skills in web layout design and responsiveness. This project reflects my progress as I continue to enhance my front-end development skills.
